This is modification of code from an Instructable by TechKiwiGadgets https://www.instructables.com/id/Retro-Pac-Man-Clock/
The purpose of the modification is to adapt the design to work with an HX8357C 480X320 TFT display.
Additionally, because the display is not a touch display. Code will be added to use physical buttons to allow the time to be set on the clock.
<br />
Above photo is the clock in a 3d printed case. <br/>I will release the 3d design for the case on Thingiverse.com in the near future.

Below photo shows the clock and RTC module.
