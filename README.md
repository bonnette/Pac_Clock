# Arduino Mega Pacman Clock

This is modification of code from an Istructable by TechKiwiGadgets https://www.instructables.com/id/Retro-Pac-Man-Clock/
The purpose of the modification is to allow the design work on an HX8357C 480X320 TFT display.
Additionally, because the display is not a touch display. Code will be added to use physical buttons to allow the time to be set on the clock.
